This is a clone of pynetstation from https://code.google.com/p/pynetstation/.
As far as I can tell, the repository is no longer maintained.  The original
reposity went with the name pynetstation because it is based off of
the C library libnetstation.  I renamed it to python-egi because the
python module is called egi.
